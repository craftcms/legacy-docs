# Field Types

Plugins can provide custom field types by creating a class that implements <api:craft\base\FieldInterface> and <api:craft\base\FieldTrait>. The class will serve both as a way to communicate various things about your field type (with static methods), and as a model that fields of its type will be instantiated with.

As a convenience, you can extend <api:craft\base\Field>, which provides a base field type implementation.

You can refer to Craftâ€™s own field classes for examples. They are located in `vendor/craftcms/cms/src/fields/`.

## Registering Custom Field Types

Once you have created your field class, you will need to register it with the Fields service, so Craft will know about it when populating the list of available field types:

```php
<?php
namespace ns\prefix;

use craft\events\RegisterComponentTypesEvent;
use craft\services\Fields;
use yii\base\Event;

class Plugin extends \craft\base\Plugin
{
    public function init()
    {
        Event::on(Fields::class, Fields::EVENT_REGISTER_FIELD_TYPES, function(RegisterComponentTypesEvent $event) {
            $event->types[] = MyField::class;
        });

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

## Delta Saving

If your field type implements `afterElementSave()`, an additional check can be added with `isFieldDirty()` to skip taking action for unchanged content.

This function checks for content changes before continuing to handle that element:

```php
public function afterElementSave(ElementInterface $element, bool $isNew)
{
    if ($element->isFieldDirty()) {
        // logic for handling saved element
    }

    parent::afterElementSave($element, $isNew);
}
```

If your field type provides its own template, that template will need to register its delta handle [as described in the Element Types section](element-types.md#delta-saving-field-content).
